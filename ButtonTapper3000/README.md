# ButtonTapper3000
Demonstrates the use of the new GameKit APIs introduced in iOS 7 for Achievements and Leaderboards.

The app lets the user play a simple tapping game, choosing from two difficulty levels and 3 time limits.  There is a leaderboard for each combination of difficulty level and time limit, as well as one for Average Tap Time.

There are achievements for playing on hard mode, playing all difficulty levels, and playing tapping once, a hundred times, and a thousand times in a single game.

**NOTE: This sample will only work with Xcode 5.0 or above.
