This is a port of the WWDC2012 of the same name

This sample application utilizes the legacy string drawing functions
and the new attributed string drawing.  Various usages and functionality
of attributed strings are demonstrated in this sample.

Perform a swipe gesture to enter drawing mode, which changes speaker
text color, italicizes and centers stage direction, and enables the
slider on the bottom right.

**NOTE: This sample will only work with Xcode 5.0 or above.
