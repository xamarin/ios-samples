# MonoGame Empty Project for iOS

This project serves as a starting-point for MonoGame iOS projects.  It is the result of working through the Part 1 - Creating iOS MonoGame Project walkthrough.  It is titled WalkingGame as that is the name of the project created by the full Introduction to MonoGame walkthrough.

This single solution contains two projects:  one for iOS and one cross-platform portable class library.

When executed this project displays only a blue screen.
