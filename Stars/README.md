# Stars

This sample provides an introduction to Core Motion by demonstrating
how to implement virtual reality.  The view controller provides a view
of rotating cubes and stars, which uses Core Motion to determine which
way the device is facing to display these elements from different
angles.

Target device must have device motion / gyroscope available to display
properly, and therefore cannot be run on a simulator.

This is a port of the WWDC2012 sample of the same name.
