# Hello Goodbye
This project shows you how to use the Accessibility API to widen your user base.

It also contains examples of API you can implement to allow a VoiceOver or Switch Control user to interact with your app.

Go to Settings > General > Accessibility. Enable "Bold Text", "Reduce Motion". Then go to Increase Contrast and enable "Reduce Transparancy" and "Darken Colors". Now restart you app and you will see changes.

Also you can play with VoiceOver. Enable it from Settings > General > Accessibility > VoiceOver
