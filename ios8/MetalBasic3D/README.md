# MetalBasic3D

This sample is an equivalent for Xcode OpenGL ES template. It shows
how to:

* Work with basic Metal classes such as MTLDevice and CAMetalLayer
* Create vertex buffers and vertex shaders
* Create fragment shaders
* Use *.metal files in Xamarin Studio

Additional effects have been added to one of the spinning cubes from
the template to demonstrate altering a single object's uniform values
per frame while keeping the other constant.

## Build Requirements

This sample requires Xcode 6.0, iOS 8.0 SDK and an A7/A8 device
