# Table Search with UISearchController

This sample demonstrates how to create a table view controller and search controller to manage the display of searchable content. It creates another custom table view controller to display the search results. This table view controller also acts as the presenter or provides context for the search results so they're presented within their own context.

This sample includes the optional—but recommended—[`UIStateRestoring`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistaterestoring) protocol. You adopt this protocol from the view controller class to save the search bar's active state, first responder status, and search bar text and restore them when the app is relaunched.
