# Bracket Stripes

This sample shows how to use bracketing API in AVFoundation. App's code demonstrates how to use Auto-exposure brackets and Manual exposure  brackets with control over ISO. As each of the bracketed frames are captured in real-time, they are "striped" into a destination image buffer and later shown in a modal image viewer.

## Build Requirements

Building this sample requires Xcode 6.0 and iOS 8.0 SDK or later, iPhone with iOS8 or later
