# Footprint

Display device location on a floorplan image.
Using Core Location, we will take the position in Latitude/Longitude and project it onto a flat floorplan. We will demonstrate how to do the conversion from the Geographic coordinates system (Latitude/Longitude) to the floorplan's image coordinate system (x,y)

**Note:** For this sample to function, you must have a floorplan for a venue that is Indoor Positioning enabled. To see the the apporpriate position on the floorplan, the device will need to be in that venue. If you are not in a venue, you must emulate a position in the venue using "Custom Location" in the simulator.

## Using Your Own Floorplan
If you have a venue floorplan you would like to use, make the following changes:

* Replace the existing `FLOORPLAN_IMAGE` in the image Assets
* Set the two anchor points in `MainViewController`: These are two points on the floorplan in Latitude/Longitude, and Image x,y

* Taking Core Location Indoors (recomended)
* What's New in Core Location (optional)
