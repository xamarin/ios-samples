# Photo Handoff

Demonstrates how to use `Handoff` technology. `Handoff` uses `NSUserActivity` class which encapsulates the state of a user activity in an application on a particular device, in a way that allows the same activity to be continued on another device.

This sample is universal - running on both iPhone and iPad, but not on simulator

## Instructions

* Enable `Handoff`: go to `Settings` application, `General` section, `Handoff and Suggested Apps` - turn on Handoff
* Enable `Bluetooth`: go to `Settings` application, `Bluetooth` section - turn on Bluetooth
* Enable `iCloud`: go to `Settings` application, `iCloud` section - log in using the same iCloud account

This sample shows how to hand off the user activity of choosing a photo for editing. On device `#1`, open the sample and tap a photo. On device `#2`, from its lock screen you will notice the app’s icon appear to the lower left. Swipe that icon in an upward direction. As a result same photo chosen on device `#1` then will open on the device `#2` for editing.  The user may apply blur and sepia-intensity filtering which is also continued as part of the activity to the other device.  In addition, `UIStateRestoration` feature is implemented, remembering the last photos edited along with the filter values.
