# Refreshing And Maintaining Your App Using Background Tasks

This is a Xamarin port of Apple's [Refreshing And Maintaining Your App Using Background Tasks][1] sample. 

Use scheduled background tasks for refreshing your app content and for performing maintenance.

## Instructions

To be able to test Background tasks, please, follow these steps:

1. Add the following key to **Info.plist** to enable Background modes:
	
	```xml
	<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
	<array>
		<string>fetch</string>
		<string>processing</string>
	</array>
	```

2. Add the following key and uniques task ids to **Info.plist**:
	
	```xml
	<key>BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers</key>
	<array>
		<string>com.xamarin.ColorFeed.refresh</string>
		<string>com.xamarin.ColorFeed.cleaning_db</string>
	</array>
	```

	You need to add a unique task id into **Info.plist** for each background task you want to execute.

3. To be able to test a background task, you need to the debug the app with Xcode by:
	
	- Following [these steps][6]
	- or by running the app on Visual Studio with Debug configuration and attaching the process to Xcode by clicking on **Debug** menu > **Attach to process** > **ColorFeed** (or the app name.)

4. Once attached to Xcode, send the app to background and open it again; this, to register the background tasks in the OS.
5. On Xcode, enable the `lldb` in the debugger by pausing the debug session.
6. In the debugger, execute the line shown below, substituting the identifier of the desired task for `TASK_IDENTIFIER`:

	```sh
	e -l objc -- (void)[[BGTaskScheduler sharedScheduler] _simulateLaunchForTaskWithIdentifier:@"TASK_IDENTIFIER"]
	```

7. Resume your app. The system launches the app in the background to run the desired task.
8. To force termination of a task, execute the line shown below, substituting the identifier of the desired task for `TASK_IDENTIFIER`.

	```sh
	e -l objc -- (void)[[BGTaskScheduler sharedScheduler] _simulateExpirationForTaskWithIdentifier:@"TASK_IDENTIFIER"]

	```

9. Resume your app. The system calls the expiration handler for the desired task.
