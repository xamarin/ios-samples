CollectionViewTransition
========================
This sample illustrates how to create a custom transition when navigating between 
two collection views in a navigation hierarchy managed by a navigation controller.

The application has two view collection view controllers that display images. 
The first is a stack view, the second is a grid view. You can transition from 
the stack to the grid by tapping on the stack. You can also use a pinch gesture, 
in which case you can control the speed of, and even reverse, the transition.

The sample exhibits the known issue that exists in the corresponding Apple sample, 
after pinching the collection view (in Grid Layout) becomes empty.

This is a port of Apple's iOS7 sample CollectionViewTransition.
