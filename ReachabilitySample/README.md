Reachability Sample
===================

Description
-----------
This sample shows how to use the APIs to find out what kind of connectivity is available.

This sample started as a line-by-line port of the Apple sample, and it
was too late when I realize that the sample was not very good to begin
with.  I have moved on to work on other things, but take this sample
(and the Apple one) with a grain of salt, it does not use the best
practices nor is it a great use of the APIs in the first place.
