OpenGLScroller
==============

This is a port of the WWDC2012 sample application of the same name.

This sample demonstrates the usage of OpenGL in a scroll view.
A swipe gesture on the top of the screen will slide the 20 small cubes left or right.
A tap gesture on any of the small cubes will cause them to change color and speed based on the large cube.
A tap gesture on the large cube will change its color and rotation speed.
