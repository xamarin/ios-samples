watchOS 3 Preview
=================

Xamarin now has a [watchOS 3 preview](https://blog.xamarin.com/let-the-ios10-ing-begin/) as part of our iOS 10 release.

1. Add a new **WatchKit for watchOS** project to an iOS 10 solution.
2. Right-click the **watchOS app** project and select **Set as startup project**
3. The simulator list should change to display a 38mm or 42mm watch option. If it doesn't change, restart Xamarin Studio and try again.
4. With a *watch simulator* selected, start debugging.

Refer to the [Xamarin watchOS docs](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/watch/) for more information. Also see the [release notes](https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/ios/xamarin.ios_10/xamarin.ios_10.0/#watchOS) and [API diff](https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/ios/api_changes/watchos_9.10.0_to_10.0.0/).
