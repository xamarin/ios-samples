# Poker Night Voting

This is a port of the WWDC2012 application of the same name

This sample application utilizes the EventKit API to allow a user to
create events at specific times.  Users can suggest times for a poker
night with friends, view times suggested by others, and vote on which
time is the most convenient.

Note: You may get an error when deleting an event with the message "CADObjectGetRelatedObjects failed with error Error Domain=NSMachErrorDomain Code=268435459 "The operation couldn’t be completed. (Mach error 268435459 - (ipc/send) invalid destination port)". This is a known Apple bug that does not interfere with the running of the sample.
