# Transitions Demo

This sample shows how to create custom view controller transitions in iOS 7. Transitions can be used in a range of contexts: push, pop, modal etc.
Sample project provides a library of custom animations which can be dropped directly into your project. It also has a number of 'interaction controllers' which can be used with any of the custom animations in order to make your transitions interactive.

Library currently contains the following transition animations:

|||||
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Flip|Fold|Crossfade|Explode|
