# tvRemote

Users of your Xamarin.tvOS app will not be interacting with its interface directly as with iOS where they tap images on the device's screen, but indirectly from across the room using the Siri Remote.

This sample presents several ways that your Xamarin.tvOS app can interact with the Siri Remote to navigate your User Interface.
