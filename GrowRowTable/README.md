# GrowRowTable

Starting with iOS 8, Apple added the ability to create a Table View (`UITableView`) that can automatically grow and shrink the height of a given Row based on the size of its content using Auto Layout, Size Classes and Constraints.

This sample shows how to create a Table View with Auto-Resizing Row Height.
