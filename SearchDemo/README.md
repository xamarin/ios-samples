# Search Demo

## DECPRECATED

This sample demonstrates how to create a master-detail style of application with a UITableViewController and UINavigationController. It also shows how to add a UISearchBar to a UITableView. The search in this case calls the Bing web service to retrieve results. The associated web page is loaded in a UIWebView when a row is selcted in the table.

The Bing web service requires an API key, which can be obtained at https://datamarket.azure.com

Once you have an API key, set it to the AZURE_KEY constant in Bing.cs.
