	/// The custom carousel accessibility element is a core part of this sample.
	/// It is illustrating a way in which we choose to tweak the accessibility experience in a unique and interesting way.
	/// If we leave the collection view as is, then the VoiceOver user has to swipe to the end of the carousel
	/// before they can reach either button or the data for the dogs, meaning that they will only ever be able to
	/// get to the data for the last dog in the carousel through swiping alone.We instead create this custom element,
	/// and make it an adjustable element that responds to `accessibilityIncrement` and `accessibilityDecrement`,
	/// so that when a user swipes from it, they swipe immediately to the favorite and gallery buttons, then on to the data,
	/// for the specific dog.In some ways, we've transformed the collection view into acting more like a picker.
