# SoupChef

This is a Xamarin port of Apple's [Soup Chef](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/accelerating_app_interactions_with_shortcuts?language=objc)
sample. It demonstrates how to create an app that makes use of Siri 
Shortcuts, introduced in iOS 12.

The application provides a way to order soup from a fictitious soup
restaurant, view your order history, and assign voice shortcuts to
orders. These voice shortcuts can then be invoked with Siri, making it
possible to order soup without even opening the app.

## Usage

To use the app, set up an order and assign it a voice shortcut:

- Open the app.
- Click the **+** button in the upper-right, and create a new soup order. 
- After creating the order, it will appear on the **Order History** screen 
in the app. Select the order, then tap **Add to Siri** on the bottom of the 
screen. 
- Record a phrase to use to make the same order again in the future with 
Siri. For example, for an order that contains two bowls of chowder with 
cheese, you might specify, "Order two bowls of chowder with cheese."

Then, order soup with Siri:

- Minimize or close the **Soup Chef** app.
- Invoke Siri in whatever way you prefer, and issue the voice command you
defined above. For example, "Hey Siri, order two bowls of chowder with 
cheese." Siri will interact with you to create and execute the order.

## Repository overview

This repository contains the following folders:

1. **OrderSoupIntentCodeGen/**

    This folder contains an Xcode project that includes the
    **Intents.intentdefinition** file that defines the custom intent
    file used by the Soup Chef app. This file is the basis for custom
    interactions with Siri, and Xcode generates some code based on its
    contents (which can be edited with Xcode). The Xamarin.iOS
    **SoupChef** project relies on a C# binding to this generated code.

2. **OrderSoupIntentStaticLib/**

    This folder contains an Xcode project used to create a static library
    from the code generated by the **OrderSoupIntentCodeGen** project
    described above. It also contains a **Makefile** to generate a C#
    binding definition (**ApiDefinitions.cs** and **StructsAndEnums.cs**
    files) for this static library, based on the .h and .m files created by
    Xcode.

    To build the static library, in the terminal change to this 
    directory, edit the Makefile to make sure that the `XBUILD` variable
    points to a valid Xcode installation, and then type `make`.

3. **OrderSoupIntentBinding/**

    This project takes the binding definition and static library created
    by the **OrderSoupIntentStaticLib** project and uses them to create
    an assembly for use in a Xamarin.iOS application. There's no reason
    to open this project directly, as it is included in the **SoupChef**
    solution.

4. **SoupChefIntents/**

    The Soup Chef Intents Extension, which performs the background work
    necessary to order soup when requested by Siri.

5. **SoupChefIntentsUI/**

    The Soup Chef Intents UI Extension, which contains the custom UI used
    to interact with Siri when ordering soup.

6. **SoupKit/**

    Shared code

7. **SoupChef/**

    The Xamarin.iOS Soup Chef app. This solution contains references to
    these other projects:

    - **OrderSoupIntentBinding**
    - **SoupChefIntents**
    - **SoupChefIntentsUI**
    - **SoupKit**

## Building the static library for the C# binding

Before building the **SoupChef** solution to run the app on your
simulator or device, you'll need to build the static library required by
the **OrderSoupIntentBinding** bindings project. To do this, open
**Terminal** on your Mac build host and do the following:

- `cd` to the **OrderSoupIntentStaticLib** directory
- Edit **Makefile**, updating the `XBUILD` variable as necessary to point
to a valid Xcode 10 installation.
- Type `make`

NOTE: Do not build this static library by opening the Xcode project
and building it. Use the `make` command instead, as it generates output
in a directory expected by the **OrderSoupIntentBinding** project.

## Running the app on simulator or device

### Setup

It can be helpful when working with Siri Shortcuts to enable two settings
on your iOS device or simulator:

- In the **Settings** app, enable **Developer > Display Recent Shortcuts**.
- In the **Settings** app, enable  **Developer > Display Donations on Lock Screen**.

These settings will surface recently created shortcuts on the lock screen
and in the search results (accessible by swiping down on the iOS home
screen).

### Running on simulator

This app works on the simulator. On the **Hardware** menu of macOS
**Simulator** application (the iOS simulator), select **Siri** to invoke
Siri, and issue commands with your voice just as you would with a
physical device.

### Running on device

To run this application on a device, you'll need to set up an App Group,
some App IDs, and some development provisioning profiles; make a few edits
to **Info.plist**, **Entitlements.plist**, and one source code file; and
configure the build settings for each project to use the correct
provisioning profiles.

Please also see the [note about automatic provisioning](#automatic-provisioning),
below.

#### App Group, App IDs, Provisioning Profiles

In the **Certificates, IDs & Profiles** section of the 
[Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/), do the following:

- Create an App Group to share data between the SoupChef app and its
extensions. For example: **group.com.yourcompanyname.SoupChef**

- Create three App IDs: one for the app itself, one for the Intents 
Extension, and one for the Intents UI Extension. For example:

    - App: **com.yourcompanyname.SoupChef**
    - Intents Extension: **com.yourcompanyname.SoupChef.Intents**
    - Intents UI Extension: **com.yourcompanyname.SoupChef.Intentsui**

    To each new App ID, assign the **SiriKit** and **App Groups**
    capabilities.

- After creating the the above App IDs, edit the **App Groups** capability
assigned to each one, specifying the App Group created above.

- Create three new development provisioning profiles, one for each of the
new App IDs.

- Download these provisioning profiles and double-click each one to install
it. If Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio 2017 is already running,
restart it to make sure it registers the new provisioning profiles.

#### Editing Info.plist, Entitlements.plist, and source code

In Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio 2017, do the following:

- Update the various **Info.plist** files. Setting the app, Intents 
Extension, and Intents UI extension bundle identifiers to the App IDs 
defined above:

    - App: **com.yourcompanyname.SoupChef**
    - Intents Extension: **com.yourcompanyname.SoupChef.Intents**
    - Intents UI Extension: **com.yourcompanyname.SoupChef.Intentsui**

- Update the three **Entitlements.plist** files included with the project. 
For the **App Groups** capability, set the group to the new App Group 
created above (in the example above, it was **group.com.yourcompanyname.SoupChef**).

- Finally, open **NSUserDefaultsHelper.cs**. Set the `AppGroup` variable
to the value of your new App Group (for example, set it to 
`group.com.yourcompanyname.SoupChef`).

#### Configure the build settings

In Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio 2017:

- Open the options/properties for the **SoupChef** project. On the 
**iOS Bundle Signing** tab, set **Signing Identity** to automatic and
**Provisioning Profile** to the new app-specific provisioning profile you
created above.

- Open the options/properties for the **SoupChefIntents** project. On the 
**iOS Bundle Signing** tab, set **Signing Identity** to automatic and
**Provisioning Profile** to the new intents project-specific provisioning 
profile you created above.

- Open the options/properties for the **SoupChefIntentsUI** project. On the 
**iOS Bundle Signing** tab, set **Signing Identity** to automatic and
**Provisioning Profile** to the new intents UI-specific provisioning profile 
you created above.

With these changes in place, the app will run on an iOS device.

#### Automatic provisioning

Note that you can use [automatic provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/device-provisioning/automatic-provisioning)
to accomplish many of these provisioning tasks directly in the IDE.
However, automatic provisioning does not set up App Groups. You will need
to manually configure the **Entitlements.plist** files with the name of
the App Group you would like to use, visit the Apple Developer Portal to
create the App Group, assign that App Group to each App ID created by
automatic provisioning, regenerate the provisioning profiles (app, Intents
Extension, Intents UI Extension) to include the newly created App Group,
and download and install them.

## Notes

- The **OrderDetail.storyboard** file makes use of secondary views, which
Xamarin's iOS Designer cannot edit. To edit these, use Xcode's Interface
Builder.
- After telling Siri to make a soup order or tapping a shortcut in a 
search result or on the lock screen, there can be a long lag before the 
user interface appears. This appears to be consistent with the Swift-based
app.
- After invoking the Siri Shortcut, there can sometimes be failures.
Again, this seems consistent with the original sample.
- The custom UI does not always load the soup icon as it should. Again, 
this is consistent with the Swift-based app.
- The application console occasionally shows an errors such as:
"Using kCFPreferencesAnyUser with a container is only allowed for 
System Containers, detaching from cfprefsd". This seems to be innocuous.
- The application console occasionally indicates "Unable to find cacheable 
object with identifier intents-remote-image-proxy." This is consistent
with the Swift-based app.

## Known Issues (TO FIX)

- After successfully completing an order made via voice, Siri does not 
report back the success message defined by the **Intents.intentdefinition**
file. 
- There is a persistent warning in the application console: "Warning:
observer object was not disposed manually with Dispose()"
