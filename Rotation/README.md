# Handling Rotation

This sample demonstrates how to handle user-interface layout changes when an iOS device is rotated.

The sample has separate examples for iPhone and iPad devices.

The code was written and testing on iOS 5. Apple made some changes to rotation handling in iOS 6 - the sample is yet to be updated to reflect those changes.
