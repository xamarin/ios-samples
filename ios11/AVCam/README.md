## Using AVFoundation to Capture Images and Movies

AVCam demonstrates how to use the  `AVFoundation` capture API to record movies and capture still images. The sample has a record button for recording movies, a camera button for switching between front and back cameras (on supported devices), and a still button for capturing still images. AVCam runs only on an actual device, either an `iPad` or `iPhone`, and cannot be run in `Simulator`.
