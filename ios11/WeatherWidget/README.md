# Building a Simple Widget for the Today View

This sample code builds a weather app that displays a simple five-day weather forecast using a horizontally paging collection view. Each collection view cell contains a label showing the day the forecast applies to, an icon representing the forecast, and a label describing it. In this example, the Today extension provides a more compact, glanceable view of the app's data.
