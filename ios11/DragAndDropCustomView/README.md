# Drag and Drop Custom View Example

This sample is a demo of the new iOS 11 Drag and Drop feature in a custom view

![drag and drop example screenshot](Screenshots/allowed-sml.png)

Test this app on an iPad - the drag and drop functionality does not work on iPhone. Open an app that handles images (such as Photos) side-by-side with this sample and drag items between the two apps.
