# MapKit Sample "Tandm"

This sample is a demo of new iOS 11 features in MapKit, grouping and splitting markers based on zoom-level.

Tandm is a fictional bike sharing application leveraging the latest MapKit features for an uncluttered map experience.
This app uses system map controls for custom layout of compass, scale and user tracking button. Marker annotation views and custom annotations views are leveraged to provide an uncluttered map using the display priority and clustering APIs.
