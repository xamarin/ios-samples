Tandm is a fictional bike sharing application leveraging the latest MapKit features for an uncluttered map experience.
This app uses system map controls for custom layout of compass, scale and user tracking button. Marker annotation views and custom annotations views are leveraged to provide an uncluttered map using the display priority and clustering APIs.
