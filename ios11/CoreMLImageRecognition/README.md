# CoreML Image Recognition

This sample is a demo of iOS 11 CoreML using different image recognition models to identify features in photographs.

The smaller, simpler SqueezeNet model is included in the project.

Follow the instructions in the [included README file](https://github.com/xamarin/ios-samples/blob/master/ios11/CoreMLImageRecognition/CoreMLImageRecognition/README.md) to download, compile, and include the VGG16 model (which is larger and more accurate).

Tap the model name in the lower-left of the screen to switch between models while the app is running.
