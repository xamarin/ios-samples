# Notifications in Xamarin.iOS

This sample illustrates how to schedule and respond to
local notifications as well as how to register the device
for, and receive remote notifications (Apple Push
Notification Service).

To learn more about how to make push notifications work please read this [guide](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/notifications/ios/remote_notifications_in_ios/).

Also original [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ConfiguringPushNotifications/ConfiguringPushNotifications.html) can be helpful, it contains broad explanation of how to set up the environment.
