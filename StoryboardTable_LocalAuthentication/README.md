# Storyboard Tables - Local Authentication

This sample is a demonstration of the final application that will be produced at the end of the [Introduction to Touch ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios/platform/touchid) guide.

FOr iOS 11 compatibility, see this [Local Authentication using Face ID or Touch ID](https://github.com/xamarin/ios-samples/tree/master/ios11/FaceIDSample). It has updated Info.plist and code to work with Face ID.
