This app demonstrates how to use Request Review, Index Display Mode and Alternate App Icons in a Xamarin.iOS.

### Alternate App Icons

Apple has added several enhancements to iOS 10.3 that allow an app to manage its icon.

### Request App Review

New to iOS 10.3, the `RequestReview()` method allows an iOS app to ask the user to rate or review it.

###ScrollView Enhancements

`UIScrollView` now include the `IndexDisplayMode` property to control how the index is shown while the user is scrolling as a `UIScrollViewIndexDisplayMode`.
