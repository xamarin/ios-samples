Eliza Test
----------

This applet implements the classic "Eliza" program, a program that communicates in natural language. 
It pretends to be a Rogerian psychologist.

The original ELIZA was described by Joseph Weizenbaum in Communications of the ACM in January 1966. 
ELIZA was one of the first programs that attempted to communicate in natural language. The article 
was an attempt to demystify the behavior of the program, and included a detailed description of the 
program. ELIZA is based on a "script" consisting of patterns and corresponding responses. An appendiz 
to the article contained the complete script for the Rogerial psychologist.

This rendition of ELIZA is a complete and faithful implementation of the program described by Weizenbaum. 
The script language has been reformatted for clarity, but is unchanged in its content.
