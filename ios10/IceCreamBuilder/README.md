# Ice Cream Builder: A simple Messages app extension

This sample is a simple example of building an app extension that interacts with the Messages app and lets users send interactive messages and create stickers.

The extension is based on a MSMessagesAppViewController subclass that then presents a child view controller depending on the current conversation, message state and presentation style. It also updates a conversation with new or updated messages and posts stickers to a conversation.

## Instructions

To test this sample you'll need to deploy it on device/simulator. Main app will show you only white screen. However the most interesting part of the app is app extension. Open Messages app and choose Ice Cream Builder in extensions.

## Build Requirements

Xcode 8.0, iOS 10.0 SDK
