# Midi Test

This sample illustrates how to use CoreAudio to load and play a MIDI sequence from a file, and uses an AUGraph to play the notes with an instrument effect.  A Virtual Endpoint is also created to intercept and display the MIDI messages as it runs.  The sample is a port the ['MIDI Driven Animation using CoreMIDI in Objective C' sample code](http://www.deluge.co/?q=midi-driven-animation-core-audio-objective-c) by Ben Smiley.
