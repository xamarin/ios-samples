# SoZoomy

SoZoomy shows how to use the AVCaptureDevice APIs to zoom with the camera. There are three modes:

- Face Detection: Displays faces detected on the screen; tapping them locks the size and will automatically adjust the zoom as the distance changes.
- Manually setting zoom: Moving the slider at the bottom of the screen adjusts the zoom accordingly
- Meme mode: Triggers an automatically zoom that ramps up quickly.
