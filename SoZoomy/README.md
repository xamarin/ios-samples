# SoZoomy
SoZoomy shows how to use the AVCaptureDevice APIs to zoom with the camera. There are three modes:

* Face Detection: Displays faces detected on the screen; tapping them locks the size and will automatically adjust the zoom as the distance changes.
* Manually setting zoom: Moving the slider at the bottom of the screen adjusts the zoom accordingly
* Meme mode: Triggers an automatically zoom that ramps up quickly.

**NOTE: This sample will only work with Xcode 5.0 or above.
