# Circle Layout

This sample provides an introduction to Collection Views. It demonstrates how to arrange view cells on a circle, and how to use custom animations when adding or removing cells.

Tap anywhere to add a new cell, or tap a cell to remove it from the view.

Based on the WWDC 2012 sample of the same name.
