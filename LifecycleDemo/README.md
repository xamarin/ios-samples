# LifeCycle Demo

This basic sample relates to the [iOS Backgrounding](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/application_fundamentals/backgrounding/) guides in the developers centre. It adds location to the `AppDelegate` to display when an application is entering a given state. You can find out more information about this by visiting the [Part 2- Application Lifecycle Demo](/guides/ios/application_fundamentals/backgrounding/part_2_application_lifecycle_demo/) guide.
