# LifeCycle Demo

This basic sample relates to the [iOS Backgrounding](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/) guides in the developers centre. It adds location to the `AppDelegate` to display when an application is entering a given state. You can find out more information about this by visiting the [Part 2- Application Lifecycle Demo](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/application-lifecycle-demo) guide.
