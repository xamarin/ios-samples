# Location in Xamarin.iOS

This is an iOS Location application that prints information about our current location: latitude, longitude, and other parameters to the screen. This application will demonstrate how to properly perform location updates while the application is either Active or Backgrounded.

It relates to the [location walkthrough doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/ios-backgrounding-walkthroughs/location-walkthrough) in the developer centre.
