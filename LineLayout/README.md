# LineLayout

This is a port of the WWDC2012 sample

This example shows how to implement a document-browser-like-interface 
as a flow layout subclass, and using automatic invalidation on bounds
change to implement the 'scale center cell' effect. It also implements
a layout-level method to adjust the scrolling final position so the 
final cell will always be centered.
