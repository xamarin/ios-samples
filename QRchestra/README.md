# QRchestra

This sample detects QR codes and decodes them.  

If the value of the QR code is a MIDI note number,
that note is played. Use these QR codes to test (they are generated by the app):

![Sample app screenshot](Screenshots/test-qr-codes.PNG)

If the value does not qualify as a MIDI note, the QR code is
highlighted on the screen and the string data from the barcode is
written to the console, eg:

```Text
Barcode string data: www.xamarin.com
```

Search online for a website or tool that can generate test QR codes.
