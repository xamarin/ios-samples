# CocosSharp BouncingGame Project for iOS

This is a small, complete game using CocosSharp for iOS.  It is the result of working through the the entire Introduction to CocosSharp walkthrough.

This single solution contains two projects:  one for iOS and one cross-platform portable class library.

The game can be played by touching the screen to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen horizontally.  The goal is to keep the ball from falling off-screen.  Each bounce awards the player one point.
