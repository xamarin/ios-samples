   <Description>Working with files and directories in iOS using MonoTouch can be done with the same 
System.IO classes that you would use in any .NET application. Despite the familiar classes and methods, 
iOS implements some restrictions on the files that you can create or access and also provides 
special features for certain directories. This article outlines those restrictions and features,

demonstrate how file access works in a MonoTouch application.</Description>
