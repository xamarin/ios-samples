	Since we perform conversion in a background thread, we must ensure that we handle interruptions appropriately.
	In this sample we're using a mutex protected variable tracking thread states. The background conversion threads state transistions from Done to Running
	to Done unless we've been interrupted in which case we are Paused blocking the conversion thread and preventing further calls
	to AudioConverterFillComplexBuffer (since it would fail if we were using the hardware codec).
	Once the interruption has ended, we unblock the background thread as the state transitions to Running once again.
	Any errors returned from AudioConverterFillComplexBuffer must be handled appropriately. Additionally, if the Audio Converter cannot
	resume conversion after an interruption, you should not call AudioConverterFillComplexBuffer again.
