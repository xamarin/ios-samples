CocosSharp Empty Project for iOS
====================================

This project serves as a starting-point for CocosSharp iOS projects.  It is the result of working through the Part 1 - Creating iOS CocosSharp Project walkthrough.  It is titled BouncingGame as that is the name of the project created by the full Introduction to CocosSharp walkthrough.

This single solution contains two projects:  one for iOS and one cross-platform portable class library.

When executed this project displays only a black screen.
