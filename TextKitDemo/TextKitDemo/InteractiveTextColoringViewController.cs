					"whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and " +
					"picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\nThere was " +

					"Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it " +

					"she was to get out again. \n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped " +
					"suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found " +
					"herself falling down a very deep well.  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she " +
					"had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. " +
					"First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; " +
					"then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; " +
					"here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; " +
					"it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar " +
					"for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. "));
