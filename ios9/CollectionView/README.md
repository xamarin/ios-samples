# Collection Views: Using the New Drag-To-Reorder Feature

In iOS 9, the Collection View (`UICollectionView`) supports dragging reordering of items out of the box by adding a new default gesture recognizer and several new supporting methods.

Using these new methods, you can easily implement drag to reorder in your Collection View and have the option of customizing the items appearance during any stage of the reordering process.

This sample demonstrates using the new drag-to-reorder feature in a Xamarin.iOS app.
