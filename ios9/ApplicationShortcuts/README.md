Application Shortcuts
==============

Demonstrates how to use the `UIApplicationShortcutItem` class to provide quick access to parts of your application directly from the device's home screen. The sample shows two static shortcuts (defined in the app's Info.plist), and two dynamic shortcuts (defined in code with the `UIMutableApplicationShortcutItem` class). The dynamic shortcuts can be edited to change the title, subtitle and icon.
