# MetalPerformanceShaders HelloWorld

This sample demonstrates how easy it is to use the MetalPerformanceShaders framework. To convince you of its ease of use, the sample shows how to process an image using the Gaussian blur kernel provided by the framework. Youâ€™ll also see how MetalPerformanceShaders integrates nicely with MetalKit. A label will be displayed in case the device does not support MetalPerformanceShaders.
