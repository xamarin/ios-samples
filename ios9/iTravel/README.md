# iTravel

This app replicates iTravel sample demonstrated on [WWDC 2015 - session 214 ](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-214/) about on-demand resources (original Swift source never been published to the official gallery). Main action happens in `AlbumViewController` class. There are three tags in this app available for downloading:
* Paris - download only on-demand
* Rotterdam - pre-fetched downloading
* Istanbul - initial downloading

You can play with tags and try different fetching settings in project's options. Official documentation about on-demand resources can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/On_Demand_Resources_Guide/).
