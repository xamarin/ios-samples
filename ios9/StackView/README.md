# StackView: Using the UIStackView Control

This sample demonstrates how to use the new Stack View control (`UIStackView`) in a Xamarin.iOS application to layout a collection of subviews and create a simple App rating interface.

The Stacked View control (`UIStackView`) leverages the power of Auto Layout and Size Classes to manage a stacked list of subviews (either horizontally or vertically) that dynamically responds to the iOS device's orientation and screen size.

By using Stacked View control, the amount of work required to layout a user interface is greatly reduced. The layout of all subviews attached to a Stacked View are managed by it based on developer defined properties such as axis, distribution, alignment and spacing.
