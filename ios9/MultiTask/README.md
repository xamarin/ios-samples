# MultiTask

iOS 9 adds multitasking support for running two apps at the same time on specific iPad hardware. Multitasking for iPad is supported via the following features:

* **Slide Over** - Allows the user to temporarily run a second iOS app in a slide out panel (either on the right or left side of the screen based on language direction) that covers approximately 25% of the main app currently running. Slide Over is available only on an iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 2, iPad Mini 3, or iPad Mini 4.
* **Split View** - On supported iPad hardware (iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 4 and iPad Pro only), the user can pick a second app and run it side-by-side with the currently running app in a split screen mode. The user can control the percentage of the main screen that each app occupies.
* **Picture in Picture** - For apps that playback video content, the video can now be played in a moveable and resizable window that floats over the other apps currently running on the iOS device. The user has full control over the size and position of this window. Picture in Picture is available only on an iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 2, iPad Mini 3, or iPad Mini 4.

Additionally, with iOS 9, apps can create their own custom keyboard shortcuts when running on an iPad with a hardware keyboard attached.

This sample demonstrates a multitasking ready Xamarin.iOS app with a custom hardware keyboard shortcut.
